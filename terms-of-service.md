# Terms of Service for Long-Form

Last updated: 2025-12-17

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Long-Form mobile application ("App"). By downloading or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

## 1. Description of the Service

Long-Form helps you save, organize and track links to YouTube videos, podcasts, books and other long-form content. The App stores your items, tags, categories, progress and notes locally on your device.

The App does not provide or host any of the third-party content you save links to.

## 2. Eligibility

You may use the App only if you are legally capable of entering into a binding agreement under the laws of your country or region. If you are under the age required in your jurisdiction, you may only use the App with permission from a parent or legal guardian.

## 3. Accounts and Registration

Long-Form does not require you to create an account. The App does not use usernames or passwords and does not synchronize your data across devices by default. All data is stored locally on your device unless you enable system-level backups or sync (such as iCloud) provided by Apple.

## 4. Your Responsibilities

You are responsible for:

- Providing accurate information when using the App  
- Ensuring that the content you save and access complies with applicable laws and the terms of the original content providers (e.g. YouTube terms)  
- Keeping your device secure and preventing unauthorized access to the App and your data  

You agree not to use the App for any unlawful purpose or in any way that could damage, disable or impair the App or interfere with other users.

## 5. Third-Party Content and Links

The App allows you to save and view links to third-party content (such as YouTube videos, podcasts and books) and may display related metadata like titles, thumbnails or duration.

- All third-party content remains the property and responsibility of the original providers.  
- Long-Form does not control and is not responsible for the availability, accuracy, legality or quality of any third-party content.  
- Your use of third-party services is governed by their own terms and privacy policies.

## 6. Data and Privacy

Information about how the App handles data is described in the **Privacy Policy**, which is incorporated by reference into these Terms. By using the App, you also agree to the Privacy Policy.

In short, Long-Form primarily stores your data locally on your device and does not transmit personal data to external servers operated by the developer, unless explicitly stated in the Privacy Policy.

## 7. Intellectual Property

The App, including its design, logo, features and underlying code, is owned by or licensed to the developer and is protected by applicable copyright and other intellectual property laws.

You are granted a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App solely for your own personal, non-commercial use. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, modify, distribute or create derivative works based on the App, except where permitted by law.

## 8. No Warranty

The App is provided **"as is"** and **"as available"** without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

The developer does not warrant that the App will be error-free, secure, or available at all times, or that it will meet your requirements.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer of Long-Form shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, or any loss of data, profits or revenues, arising out of or related to your use of or inability to use the App.

In any case, the total liability of the developer for any claim arising out of or relating to the App shall be limited to the amount you paid (if any) for using the App in the 12 months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you.

## 10. Changes to the App and to These Terms

The developer may update or change the App, including adding or removing features, at any time.

The developer may also update these Terms from time to time. When changes are made, the "Last updated" date at the top of this document will be revised. Your continued use of the App after changes to the Terms means you accept the updated Terms.

If you do not agree with the updated Terms, you must stop using the App and uninstall it from your device.

## 11. Termination

You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it from your device.

The developer may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time and for any reason, including if you violate these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the App will immediately cease.

## 12. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of your country or region of residence, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Your local mandatory consumer protection laws may also apply.
